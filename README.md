# LibTIFSteganography
A place to start with steganography using TIF files.

LibTIFSteganography provides the capability to store data within TIF files using the alpha channel.  Steganography, in digital terms, is about using other file types to store information, often with features which provide stealth.  

GIMP  
Images can be edited in GIMP to remove the alpha channel and restore the original image.  Go to Layer->Transparency->Threshold Alpha and set the value to 0.0.
